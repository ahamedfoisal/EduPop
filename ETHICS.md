# Ethics in the EduPop Project

## Introduction

The **EduPop** project aims to create a dataset by scraping school and population data from publicly available resources. This project uses web scraping and API calls to gather valuable data, process it, and create insights that could help in educational planning and urban resource allocation. However, when dealing with web scraping and data processing, ethical considerations are crucial to ensure responsible and respectful use of the information.

## Ethical Considerations

### 1. **Compliance with Website Terms of Service**
   - Before scraping data, I reviewed the **robots.txt** file of the website being scraped, ensuring that the site permits data scraping for non-commercial purposes. This is in compliance with legal and ethical norms, as scraping a website without respecting its terms can cause harm to the website's operations and violate its intellectual property rights.
   - The scraped website does not impose restrictions on non-commercial data gathering, ensuring that this project complies with legal and ethical requirements.

### 2. **Rate Limiting and Reducing Server Load**
   - **EduPop** implements rate limiting and introduces pauses in scraping operations to prevent overloading the target server. This reduces the risk of negatively affecting the website's performance and avoids denial of service to other users of the site.
   - By adding a delay between each request, the project respects the website’s resources and infrastructure.

### 3. **Data Privacy**
   - The data used in this project is publicly available and does not include any sensitive, personally identifiable information (PII) of individuals or students. This ensures that no breach of privacy or misuse of personal data occurs during the project.
   - The purpose of this project is strictly academic, aimed at creating valuable datasets for educational resource allocation and research purposes, with no intention to harm or misuse any personal information.

### 4. **Transparency and Fair Use**
   - The data and methods used in this project are transparently documented in the **README.md** file to inform others about the sources and techniques. The intention is to build on public information ethically while ensuring full transparency.
   - **EduPop** does not claim ownership over the scraped data but merely presents a refined dataset. Users of this data are encouraged to check the original data sources to ensure that they are using the information responsibly and within the scope of the website’s terms of service.

### 5. **No Misrepresentation**
   - The dataset created does not alter or misrepresent the data from its original source. The project ensures that the integrity of the information is maintained during processing, cleaning, and analysis.
   - Data is processed only for the purpose of creating new insights, and no false or misleading information is presented.

### 6. **Non-commercial Intent**
   - This project is developed purely for educational purposes and does not intend to be used for commercial profit or exploitation. Any data generated through this project is intended for research, educational planning, and academic use only.

### 7. **Educational and Social Benefit**
   - The ultimate goal of the **EduPop** project is to provide value to educational institutions, researchers, and urban planners by offering insights into the correlation between population density and school availability. This can assist in making informed decisions regarding resource allocation, school planning, and improving educational infrastructure.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these ethical guidelines, **EduPop** ensures responsible and respectful handling of the data, compliance with legal standards, and prioritization of privacy and transparency. We believe that this project can contribute positively to society by providing insights that are both valuable and ethically sourced.
